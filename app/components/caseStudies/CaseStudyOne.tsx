        Hello! I’m a multidisciplinary designer with a background in interaction
        design, product strategy, and user research. My work bridges intuitive
        interfaces, elegant motion, and deeply human problem-solving. I have
        experience across startups, institutional design teams, and
        collaborative community projects. I thrive in ambiguity, build clarity
        through research and iteration, and obsess over how people actually use
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Design, for me, isn’t about just making things pretty. It’s about
        enabling people to do things better, feel supported, or see themselves
        reflected in a space or product. I’ve worked on tools for creative
        professionals, interfaces for astronauts, and public spaces for
        storytelling. I move fluidly between pixels and people, screens and
        systems.

        Whether I’m prototyping UX flows in Figma, guiding product direction
        with founders, or co-designing with local communities, I bring a
        principled but curious approach. This portfolio shares six
        representative projects—from startups to NASA to grassroots urbanism.
        Thanks for exploring.
