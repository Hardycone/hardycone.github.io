      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Boston’s Chinatown is rich with history—but under threat from
        development and erasure. We joined a public design initiative to
        reimagine its streetscapes in ways that honored cultural heritage while
        creating modern, inclusive public space.
      </p>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        We worked with historians, artists, and Chinatown residents. Key themes
        included resistance to gentrification, pride in immigrant stories, and a
        desire for visibility. We documented visual motifs from signage, murals,
        and family shrines. We hosted walking tours and oral history sessions
        that informed the site’s narrative anchors.
      </p>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        The design included: A public plaza with inlaid poetry in multiple
        Chinese dialects An interactive light sculpture referencing traditional
        paper lanterns Ground murals co-designed with local youth centers
        QR-linked stories embedded in public furniture Accessibility,
        maintenance, and placemaking were central. We balanced visual richness
        with practical durability.

        The project became a cultural landmark. Tourists and residents alike
        engaged with the stories woven into the space. A local newspaper called
        it “a love letter in bricks and light.” It also sparked policy
        conversations around heritage zoning and community-led urbanism.
