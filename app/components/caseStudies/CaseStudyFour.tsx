      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        NASA challenged student teams to imagine how AR could augment spacesuits
        for lunar and Martian missions. Our team—a mix of engineers, designers,
        and scientists—tackled this frontier: what should astronauts see in
        their HUDs while exploring alien terrain?
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        We started by studying existing EVA procedures, astronaut interviews,
        and NASA’s Artemis mission goals. Key pain points included situational
        awareness, memory load, and navigation. We also consulted AR usability
        studies in extreme environments. We ran low-fidelity field simulations
        using AR headsets in outdoor settings to replicate astronaut tasks like
        sample collection and terrain scanning.
      </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        Our system focused on four key features: Geospatial Awareness: real-time
        path mapping and waypoint marking Task Guidance: visual instructions
        synced with mission protocols Environmental Alerts: on-HUD hazard cues
        (e.g. radiation zones) Team Comms: minimalist indicators of other
        astronauts' positions We used HoloLens 2 as a development platform.
        Design focused on minimizing cognitive load and ensuring info was
        glanceable. Voice and gesture controls were optimized for gloves and
        limited dexterity.

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        Our concept placed in the top 5 nationally. NASA judges commended our
        integration of technical realism and UX detail. Our demo video and
        interface design were featured at a space tech symposium. Several
        elements informed ongoing HCI research in extreme environments.
