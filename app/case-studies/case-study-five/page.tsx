      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        In a rural village facing economic decline, residents rallied around a
        local natural site—a small but beautiful waterfall—as a symbol of
        renewal. We partnered with community leaders to redesign the surrounding
        public space, making it accessible, inviting, and deeply local.
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        We conducted participatory workshops with residents, elders, and
        students. Themes emerged: pride in the landscape, memories of childhood
        visits, and a desire for public space to foster intergenerational
        connection. We mapped informal paths, usage patterns, and seasonal
        changes. Environmental concerns around erosion and runoff were also key.
      </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        The final design included: A low-impact trail with storytelling signs
        written by locals A small amphitheater for events and gatherings Stone
        seating and wooden bridges made by local artisans Plantings of native
        species co-designed with schoolchildren We avoided imposing “outside”
        aesthetics. Every element was co-designed and approved through community
        review.
      </p>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        The space reopened with a village celebration. Foot traffic increased,
        and a nearby cafe reopened to serve visitors. The project was
        highlighted in a regional planning journal as a model for participatory
        design. Most importantly, locals described the space as “ours”—a small
        but powerful shift.
