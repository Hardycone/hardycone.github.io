      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Filmmakers often have great ideas but struggle to translate them into
        structured scripts and visual plans. We partnered with a team of indie
        filmmakers and technologists to create a tool that helps storytellers go
        from premise to production—with AI-enhanced tools for storyboarding and
        voice.
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        We ran discovery sessions with 15 independent creators and small
        production teams. They described a fragmented process: notes in Google
        Docs, sketches in notebooks, and scattered tools for voiceover and
        visualization. What they wanted was creative momentum—tools that support
        flow, not friction. We also studied screenwriting and story structure
        pedagogy, integrating ideas from Save the Cat and The Hero’s Journey to
        inform potential prompts and scaffolds.
      </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        We designed an app with four core tools: Story Engine: guided narrative
        scaffolding with flexible templates AI Storyboards: auto-generated
        visual scenes from descriptions Script Editor: screenplay formatting
        with beat tracking Voice Studio: AI voices to prototype tone, pace, and
        narration The UI was optimized for minimal context switching. We used a
        timeline layout to help writers visualize progression. We built a
        lightweight collaboration model for teams.
      </p>
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        After launching the MVP, we onboarded 300 users in three months. Many
        cited the AI storyboards as their favorite feature—it helped them pitch
        ideas visually before production. We saw diverse use cases: from solo
        YouTubers to nonprofit doc teams. The product earned recognition from
        the Sundance Institute’s Story Lab and continues to evolve as a creative
        catalyst for narrative thinkers.
